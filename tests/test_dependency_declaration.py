"""`requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` must not drift apart.

The project ships through two independent paths and they resolve different
dependency lists:

    install.sh / Docker  ->  requirements.txt
    pip / uvx / npx / brew / the wheel  ->  pyproject [project.dependencies]

Anything listed only in `requirements.txt` is missing from every packaged
install — and because the code degrades instead of crashing, nobody finds out.
This has now happened four times: `migrations/`, `vocabularies/`, `filters/`
(all fixed by packaging them) and `fastembed`.

`fastembed` is the one that changed behaviour rather than crashing. It is the
*default* embedding backend, so without it the server silently falls back to
sentence-transformers with a different, English-only model — the two install
paths retrieve differently. (Measured: the fallback is actually *lighter*,
565 MB against 921 MB, because the models differ in size. The memory problem
users reported was torch being imported eagerly, which is a separate fix — so
this is a consistency guard, not a performance one.)

So the two lists are compared here, with an explicit allow-list for packages
that are genuinely optional (guarded import, documented fallback).

Since 13.0.2 there is a second failure mode guarded here, the mirror image of
the first: a dependency that is declared and should not be. The torch stack
(sentence-transformers, transformers, FlagEmbedding, peft) resolves torch plus
the whole nvidia-cu* set — 147 packages / ~3.1 GB of linux x86_64 wheels against
97 / ~113 MB without it — for a reranker that ``MEMORY_MODE=fast`` disables and
an embedding fallback that ``MEMORY_ALLOW_OLLAMA_IN_HOT_PATH=false`` forbids.
It broke the Glama build sandbox outright ("No space left on device" unpacking
nvidia-cudnn-cu13). It now lives in the ``rerank`` extra, and
``test_the_torch_stack_stays_out_of_the_base_install`` keeps it there.
