## Works With

- **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)** — full MCP integration, hooks, auto-triggers
- **[OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)** — shared memory database, dedicated installer
- **Any MCP-compatible client** — standard Model Context Protocol server

---

## Features

**Search and Retrieval**
- 4-tier search pipeline: FTS5 keyword (BM25) -> semantic (ChromaDB) -> fuzzy (SequenceMatcher) -> graph expansion
- Decay scoring: recent knowledge ranks higher, stale knowledge fades
- Spaced repetition: frequently recalled knowledge gets boosted
- 3-level progressive disclosure: compact (~50 tokens/result), summary (150 chars), full -- up to 10x token savings
- Token cost estimation: each result includes estimated tokens, response includes total_tokens
- Branch-aware context: knowledge and sessions tagged with git branch, filterable on recall

**Knowledge Management**
- Five knowledge types: decision, solution, lesson, fact, convention
- Automatic deduplication via Jaccard + fuzzy similarity (thresholds: 0.85 / 0.90)
- Version history with supersession chains
- Knowledge graph with typed relations between records
- Tag-based browsing and filtering

**Privacy and Security** (new in v4.0)
- Automatic redaction of sensitive data: API keys, JWTs, passwords, credit card numbers, emails, IP addresses
- `<private>` tag support for explicit content exclusion
- All redaction happens before database storage -- sensitive data never persists

**Observations** (new in v4.0)
- Lightweight file change tracking via `memory_observe` -- no dedup, no vector embeddings
- Six observation types: bugfix, feature, refactor, change, discovery, decision
- Automatic cleanup after 30 days
- Ideal for tracking what changed and why during a session

**Self-Improving Agent** (v3.0)
- Automatic error logging with structured categories and severity levels
- Pattern detection: 3+ errors of the same category in 30 days triggers an insight suggestion
- Insight extraction with ExpeL-style voting (importance + confidence scoring)
- Rule promotion: high-confidence insights become persistent behavioral rules (SOUL)
- Auto-suspend: rules with success rate below 20% after 10+ applications are suspended
- Session reflections for meta-observations about strategy and approach
- Rules loaded at session start, rated after task completion -- a closed feedback loop

**Lifecycle and Maintenance**
- Retention zones: active -> archived (180d) -> purged (365d)
- Consolidation: find and merge similar records
- Full JSON export for backup and migration
- Session transcript extraction for post-session knowledge mining

**Dashboard**
- Web UI at `localhost:37737`
- Statistics, health score, knowledge table with token estimates, session browser
- Interactive knowledge graph visualization
- Self-Improvement tab: error patterns, insights, promotion candidates
- Rules/SOUL tab: active rules, effectiveness metrics, success rates
- Live Feed tab (new in v4.0): real-time SSE stream of knowledge, errors, and observations
- Branch filter for knowledge browsing
- Read-only -- safe to leave running

## Quick Start

### Option A: One-Command Install

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vbcherepanov/claude-total-memory.git
cd claude-total-memory
bash install.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/vbcherepanov/claude-total-memory.git
cd claude-total-memory
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
```

The installer creates a Python venv, installs dependencies, downloads the embedding model, and configures Claude Code automatically.

### Option B: Manual Setup

**1. Clone and install dependencies**

macOS / Linux:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vbcherepanov/claude-total-memory.git
cd claude-total-memory
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install "mcp[cli]>=1.0.0" chromadb sentence-transformers
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/vbcherepanov/claude-total-memory.git
cd claude-total-memory
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install "mcp[cli]>=1.0.0" chromadb sentence-transformers
```

**2. Configure Claude Code**

Edit `~/.claude/settings.json` (macOS/Linux) or `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json` (Windows) and add the MCP server. All paths must be absolute:

macOS / Linux:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "/FULL/PATH/TO/claude-total-memory/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/FULL/PATH/TO/claude-total-memory/src/server.py"],
      "env": {
        "CLAUDE_MEMORY_DIR": "/Users/yourname/.claude-memory",
        "EMBEDDING_MODEL": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Windows:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "C:/Users/yourname/claude-total-memory/.venv/Scripts/python.exe",
      "args": ["C:/Users/yourname/claude-total-memory/src/server.py"],
      "env": {
        "CLAUDE_MEMORY_DIR": "C:/Users/yourname/.claude-memory",
        "EMBEDDING_MODEL": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Important:** MCP server configuration does not support `~`, `$HOME`, or `%USERPROFILE%` in paths. You must use fully expanded absolute paths. On Windows, use forward slashes (`/`) in JSON paths -- they work correctly with Python.

**3. Verify**

Restart Claude Code. You should see `memory` listed in the MCP servers. Run `memory_stats()` to confirm the connection.

---

## How It Works

### Search Pipeline

When `memory_recall` is called, the query passes through four tiers:

```
Query: "docker networking between containers"
             |
             v
  +---------------------+
  | Tier 1: FTS5 + BM25 |  Keyword search with relevance ranking
  +---------------------+
             |
             v
  +---------------------+
  | Tier 2: Semantic     |  ChromaDB cosine similarity on embeddings
  +---------------------+
             |
             v
  +---------------------+
  | Tier 3: Fuzzy        |  SequenceMatcher for typos and partial matches
  +---------------------+
             |
             v
  +---------------------+
  | Tier 4: Graph        |  Follow relations from top 5 results (1 hop)
  +---------------------+
             |
             v
  +---------------------+
  | Decay + Rank + Boost |  Apply time decay, recall boost, final sort
  +---------------------+
             |
             v
        Top N results
```

Results from all tiers are merged. Records found by multiple tiers receive combined scores.

### Decay Scoring

Knowledge decays over time unless confirmed or recalled:

```
score = base_score * e^(-days * ln(2) / half_life) + recall_boost
```

- `half_life`: 90 days (configurable via `DECAY_HALF_LIFE`)
- `recall_boost`: `min(0.3, recall_count * 0.05)` -- frequently used knowledge stays relevant
- Records confirmed on last recall get their `last_confirmed` timestamp refreshed

### Retention Zones

```
                  180 days               365 days
    Active --------+-----> Archived ------+-----> Purged
                   |                      |
        (unrecalled, low confidence)  (all archived)
```

- **Active**: searchable, fully available
- **Archived**: removed from search, still in database
- **Purged**: marked for cleanup

Only records with `recall_count = 0` and `confidence < 0.8` are candidates for archival.

### Deduplication

On every `memory_save`, the server checks for existing similar knowledge:

1. FTS5 search for candidate matches (top 5)
2. Jaccard similarity > 0.85 -- deduplicated
3. Fuzzy ratio > 0.90 -- deduplicated

When a duplicate is found, the existing record's `last_confirmed` timestamp is refreshed instead of creating a new record.

---

## Self-Improving Agent

New in v3.0. The self-improvement system gives Claude the ability to learn from mistakes across sessions. It follows a three-level pipeline inspired by the ExpeL (Experience and Learning) and Reflexion research patterns.

### Pipeline Overview

```
  Error occurs (bash fail, wrong assumption, API error, ...)
       |
       v
  +------------------+
  | self_error_log   |  Log structured error with category, severity, fix
  +------------------+
       |
       | (3+ errors of same category within 30 days)
       v
  +------------------+
  | Pattern Detected |  System flags the pattern automatically
  +------------------+
       |
       v
  +------------------+
  | self_insight     |  Extract a generalizable lesson from the pattern
  | (add)            |  Initial: importance=2, confidence=0.5
  +------------------+
       |
       | Confirmed again? -> upvote (+1 importance, +0.05 confidence)
       | Wrong? -> downvote (-1 importance, auto-archive at 0)
       |
       | (importance >= 5 AND confidence >= 0.8)
       v
  +------------------+
  | self_insight     |  Promote insight to a behavioral rule
  | (promote)        |
  +------------------+
       |
       v
  +------------------+
  | self_rules       |  Rule becomes part of SOUL
  | (SOUL)           |  Loaded at session start, rated after tasks
  +------------------+
       |
       | success_rate < 0.2 after 10+ fires?
       v
  +------------------+
  | Auto-Suspend     |  Ineffective rules are suspended automatically
  +------------------+
```

### Error Categories

| Category | When to Log |
|----------|------------|
| `code_error` | Bash command fails, test fails after changes, compilation error |
| `logic_error` | Incorrect reasoning about code behavior or architecture |
| `config_error` | Missing config, wrong dependency, environment issue |
| `api_error` | External API returns 4xx/5xx or unexpected response |
| `timeout` | Operation hangs, request times out |
| `loop_detected` | Same fix attempted 3+ times without success |
| `wrong_assumption` | Assumption about codebase proved incorrect |
| `missing_context` | Had to ask user because context was insufficient |

### Insight Lifecycle

| Stage | Importance | Confidence | What Happens |
|-------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Created | 2 | 0.50 | Extracted from error pattern, linked to source errors |
| Upvoted | +1 per vote | +0.05 per vote | Confirmed by encountering the same pattern again |
| Downvoted | -1 per vote | -0.05 per vote | Contradicted by evidence |
| Archived | 0 | any | Auto-archived when importance drops to 0 |
| Promoted | >= 5 | >= 0.80 | Becomes a behavioral rule in the SOUL |

### Rule Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `active` | Loaded at session start, applied during work |
| `suspended` | Auto-suspended (success_rate < 0.2 after 10+ fires) or manually paused |
| `retired` | Permanently deactivated, kept for history |

### Session Workflow

1. **Session start**: call `self_rules_context(project="...")` to load active rules
2. **During work**: call `self_error_log(...)` on every error automatically
3. **Pattern detected**: the system returns `pattern_detected: true` -- call `self_insight(action='add', ...)`
4. **Insight confirmed**: call `self_insight(action='upvote', id=N)` when seeing the same pattern
5. **Promotion ready**: the system returns `promotion_eligible: true` -- call `self_insight(action='promote', id=N)`
6. **Task complete**: call `self_rules(action='rate', id=N, success=true/false)` for each rule used
7. **Session end**: call `self_reflect(...)` with meta-observations about the session

### Periodic Analysis

Run `self_patterns(view='full_report')` periodically to see:
- Most frequent error categories
- Insights ready for promotion
- Rule effectiveness rankings
- Weekly error trend (improving or not)

---

## Web Dashboard

The installer sets up the dashboard as a system service that starts automatically on login:

- **macOS**: LaunchAgent (`com.claude-total-memory.dashboard`)
- **Windows**: Scheduled Task (`ClaudeTotalMemoryDashboard`)

Open [http://localhost:37737](http://localhost:37737) in your browser.

To start manually (if not using the installer):

```bash
# macOS / Linux
.venv/bin/python src/dashboard.py

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\python.exe src\dashboard.py
```

Dashboard management:

```bash
# macOS — stop / start / logs
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.claude-total-memory.dashboard
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-total-memory.dashboard.plist
tail -f ~/.claude-memory/logs/dashboard.log
```

```powershell
# Windows — stop / start / remove
Stop-ScheduledTask -TaskName ClaudeTotalMemoryDashboard
Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName ClaudeTotalMemoryDashboard
Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName ClaudeTotalMemoryDashboard
```

The dashboard provides:

- **Statistics**: total knowledge, sessions, projects, health score, storage size, self-improvement stats
- **Knowledge table**: searchable and filterable list of all active records with detail modal
- **Sessions**: chronological session history with knowledge counts
- **Graph**: interactive force-directed visualization of knowledge relations
- **Self-Improvement** (new in v3.0): error patterns, insight candidates, promotion pipeline
- **Rules/SOUL** (new in v3.0): active rules with fire counts, success rates, and status management

The dashboard is read-only and connects to the same SQLite database used by the MCP server (via WAL mode for safe concurrent access).

---

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables set in the MCP server config:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CLAUDE_MEMORY_DIR` | `~/.claude-memory` | Root directory for all storage |
| `EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Sentence transformer model for semantic search |
| `DECAY_HALF_LIFE` | `90` | Days until knowledge score decays to 50% |
| `ARCHIVE_AFTER_DAYS` | `180` | Days before unrecalled records are archived |
| `PURGE_AFTER_DAYS` | `365` | Days before archived records are purged |
| `DASHBOARD_PORT` | `37737` | HTTP port for the web dashboard |

---

## Making Memory Automatic

The MCP server provides the tools -- but Claude needs **instructions** to use them proactively. There are three layers of configuration, from broadest to most specific:

### Layer 1: Global Rules (all projects)

Add memory instructions to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` so Claude uses memory in **every** project, even ones without their own CLAUDE.md:

```bash
# Append the template to your global rules
cat global-rules.md.template >> ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

Or copy the relevant sections manually. The key instructions are:
- **Always recall** before starting a task (`memory_recall`)
- **Always save** after significant actions (`memory_save`) -- without asking
- **Always log errors** automatically (`self_error_log`) -- without asking
- **Load rules** at session start (`self_rules_context`)
- Use the correct knowledge types (decision, solution, lesson, fact, convention)

See `global-rules.md.template` for the full ready-to-paste block.

### Layer 2: Project CLAUDE.md (per project)

Copy `CLAUDE.md.template` to a specific project's root to add project-specific memory rules:

```bash
cp CLAUDE.md.template /path/to/your/project/CLAUDE.md
```

Then replace every `my-project` with your actual project name. This ensures all knowledge is tagged with the correct project for filtered recall later.

The project template adds:
- Auto-recall with project filter before every task
- Auto-save triggers with project name and tags
- Auto-error-logging triggers for self-improvement
- Knowledge type reference table
- Maintenance commands

### Layer 3: Custom Agents (per agent)

If you use custom agents (`.claude/agents/*.md`), each agent needs its own memory instructions. See `agent-rules.md.template` for three options:

**Option A: Full block** -- add a complete Memory System section to the agent's .md file with recall/save rules and trigger table.

**Option B: Full agent example** -- use the template as a starting point for a new agent that has memory built in.

**Option C: One-liner** -- add a single line to existing agents:

```
Use memory_recall before tasks and memory_save after decisions/fixes/lessons. Use self_error_log on failures. Project: "my-project".
```

### How the layers work together

```
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md          -> "Always use memory_recall and memory_save"
                                "Always log errors with self_error_log"
                                (applies to ALL projects)

/your-project/CLAUDE.md      -> "Project is 'my-app', save with these tags"
                                (adds project-specific context)

.claude/agents/backend.md    -> "You are a backend developer. Use memory."
                                (adds agent-specific behavior)
```

All three layers are optional. Each one makes memory more automatic:
- **Global only**: Claude uses memory everywhere, but without project filtering
- **Global + Project**: Claude uses memory with proper project tags
- **All three**: Custom agents also use memory proactively

### What "automatic" means

With proper configuration, Claude will:

1. **At session start** -- search memory for context relevant to the current task and load behavioral rules
2. **During work** -- save decisions, bug fixes, gotchas, and conventions as they happen
3. **On every error** -- log failures with category, severity, and fix for pattern analysis
4. **At session end** -- save a summary of what was accomplished and reflect on the session
5. **Never ask** "should I save this?" -- it just saves automatically
6. **Never duplicate** -- the server deduplicates via Jaccard + fuzzy similarity
7. **Learn over time** -- errors become insights, insights become rules, rules improve behavior

### Templates reference

| `codex-skill/` | Memory skill for Codex | `~/.agents/skills/memory/` |

---

## Hooks (Optional)

Ready-to-use hooks are provided in the `hooks/` directory:

| Hook | macOS/Linux | Windows | What it does |
|------|-------------|---------|--------------|
| SessionStart | `hooks/session-start.sh` | `hooks/session-start.ps1` | Detects project/branch, reminds Claude to use `memory_recall` and `self_rules_context` |
| Stop | `hooks/on-stop.sh` | `hooks/on-stop.ps1` | Reminds Claude to save knowledge and reflect |
| PostToolUse:Bash | `hooks/memory-trigger.sh` | `hooks/memory-trigger.ps1` | Suggests `memory_save` after git/docker/npm/pip/go/cargo/composer |
| PostToolUse:Write | `hooks/auto-capture.sh` | `hooks/auto-capture.ps1` | Suggests `memory_observe` after file changes (new in v4.0) |
| PostToolUse:Edit | `hooks/auto-capture.sh` | `hooks/auto-capture.ps1` | Same as Write -- tracks file edits (new in v4.0) |

> **Note:** The `install.sh` / `install.ps1` installer automatically registers all hooks in `settings.json`. Manual registration is only needed for custom setups.

**macOS / Linux** -- add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "/FULL/PATH/TO/claude-total-memory/hooks/session-start.sh"
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "/FULL/PATH/TO/claude-total-memory/hooks/on-stop.sh"
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "/FULL/PATH/TO/claude-total-memory/hooks/memory-trigger.sh",
        "matcher": "Bash"
      },
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "/FULL/PATH/TO/claude-total-memory/hooks/auto-capture.sh",
        "matcher": "Write"
      },
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "/FULL/PATH/TO/claude-total-memory/hooks/auto-capture.sh",
        "matcher": "Edit"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Windows** -- add to `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:/Users/yourname/claude-total-memory/hooks/session-start.ps1"
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:/Users/yourname/claude-total-memory/hooks/on-stop.ps1"
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:/Users/yourname/claude-total-memory/hooks/memory-trigger.ps1",
        "matcher": "Bash"
      },
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:/Users/yourname/claude-total-memory/hooks/auto-capture.ps1",
        "matcher": "Write"
      },
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:/Users/yourname/claude-total-memory/hooks/auto-capture.ps1",
        "matcher": "Edit"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can also add a session-end hook that calls `extract_transcript.py` to compress the session transcript and queue it for knowledge extraction on the next session start:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
python3 /FULL/PATH/TO/claude-total-memory/src/extract_transcript.py \
  --transcript "$TRANSCRIPT_PATH" \
  --session-id "$SESSION_ID" \
  --output-dir ~/.claude-memory/extract-queue \
  --db ~/.claude-memory/memory.db
```

The transcript extractor:
- Compresses transcripts to under 200 KB
- Redacts sensitive data (API keys, tokens, secrets)
- Auto-saves a session summary directly to the database
- Queues the full transcript for detailed extraction via `memory_extract_session`

---

## Storage Structure

```
~/.claude-memory/
  memory.db              SQLite database (8 tables: sessions, knowledge, relations,
                         timeline, errors, insights, rules, observations + FTS5 indexes)
  raw/                   Raw JSONL session logs
    mcp_20260215_*.jsonl
  chroma/                ChromaDB vector store (semantic embeddings)
  transcripts/           Archived session transcripts
  extract-queue/         Pending/completed transcript extractions
    pending-*.json
    done-*.json
  backups/               JSON exports from memory_export
    export_all_*.json
```

Typical storage sizes after moderate use:

| Component | Approximate Size |
|-----------|-----------------|
| SQLite (memory.db) | 1-10 MB |
| ChromaDB vectors | 10-50 MB |
| Raw logs | 5-20 MB |
| Transcripts | 1-10 MB |

## Knowledge Types

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| `decision` | Architectural or design choice. **Always include WHY in context.** | "Chose pgx over database/sql for connection pooling and pgx-specific features" |
| `solution` | Bug fix, workaround, or resolution to a problem. | "Fixed Bitrix24 batch timeout by chunking requests to 50 items with 200ms delay" |
| `lesson` | Gotcha, pitfall, or unexpected behavior discovered. | "Docker Compose v2 requires `depends_on.condition: service_healthy` -- silent failure without it" |
| `fact` | Configuration, version, endpoint, or objective information. | "Production PostgreSQL 18 on port 5433, max_connections=200" |
| `convention` | Project pattern, coding standard, or team agreement. | "All DTOs must be final readonly classes with constructor promotion" |

---

## Relation Types

| Type | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `causal` | A caused or led to B | "Timeout error (A) caused us to implement chunking (B)" |
| `solution` | B is the solution to A | "Memory leak (A) was solved by connection pooling (B)" |
| `context` | B provides context for A | "API rate limits (B) explain why we use queues (A)" |
| `related` | A and B are related | "Docker config (A) relates to CI/CD pipeline (B)" |
| `contradicts` | A contradicts B | "Old API docs (A) contradict actual behavior (B)" |

---

## Architecture

The server is a single-file MCP server (`src/server.py`, ~2100 lines) built on:

- **MCP SDK** (`mcp` package): protocol implementation and stdio transport
- **SQLite FTS5**: full-text search with BM25 scoring, triggers for index sync
- **ChromaDB**: persistent vector store with cosine similarity search
- **sentence-transformers**: local embedding model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384d)

The database contains 8 tables: `sessions`, `knowledge`, `relations`, `timeline` (core), `observations` (auto-capture), and `errors`, `insights`, `rules` (self-improvement).

```

```

- **Store**: handles writes -- save, update, delete, consolidate, retention, dedup
- **Recall**: handles reads -- 4-tier search, timeline browsing, statistics
- **Self-Improvement**: handles learning -- error logging, pattern detection, insight management, rule lifecycle
- **Dashboard** (`src/dashboard.py`): standalone HTTP server using Python stdlib, read-only SQLite access

The server creates a new session ID on each startup and logs all tool calls to raw JSONL files for auditability.

## Using with OpenAI Codex CLI

The same MCP server works with OpenAI Codex CLI. No changes to `server.py` or the dashboard are needed -- the MCP protocol is identical.

### Quick Start (Codex)

If you already have Claude Total Memory installed for Claude Code:

```bash
bash install-codex.sh
```

Fresh install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vbcherepanov/claude-total-memory.git
cd claude-total-memory
bash install-codex.sh
```

Windows:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/vbcherepanov/claude-total-memory.git
cd claude-total-memory
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install-codex.ps1
```

The Codex installer reuses the same Python venv and memory database. If you already ran `install.sh`, dependencies are not re-downloaded.

### Manual MCP Configuration (Codex)

Edit `~/.codex/config.toml` and add:

```toml
[mcp_servers.memory]
command = "/FULL/PATH/TO/claude-total-memory/.venv/bin/python"
args = ["/FULL/PATH/TO/claude-total-memory/src/server.py"]
required = true
startup_timeout_sec = 15.0
tool_timeout_sec = 120.0

[mcp_servers.memory.env]
CLAUDE_MEMORY_DIR = "/Users/yourname/.claude-memory"
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
```

Windows paths use forward slashes in TOML:

```toml
[mcp_servers.memory]
command = "C:/Users/yourname/claude-total-memory/.venv/Scripts/python.exe"
args = ["C:/Users/yourname/claude-total-memory/src/server.py"]
required = true

[mcp_servers.memory.env]
CLAUDE_MEMORY_DIR = "C:/Users/yourname/.claude-memory"
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
```

### AGENTS.md Setup (Codex)

Codex CLI uses `AGENTS.md` instead of `CLAUDE.md` for instructions. The setup mirrors the Claude Code approach with three layers:

**Layer 1: Global rules** -- append `codex-global-rules.md.template` to `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`:

```bash
cat codex-global-rules.md.template >> ~/.codex/AGENTS.md
```

**Layer 2: Project rules** -- copy `AGENTS.md.template` to your project root:

```bash
cp AGENTS.md.template /path/to/your/project/AGENTS.md
# Then replace "my-project" with your project name
```

**Layer 3: Codex Skill** -- the installer copies `codex-skill/` to `~/.agents/skills/memory/` automatically. To install manually:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills/memory/agents
cp codex-skill/SKILL.md ~/.agents/skills/memory/
cp codex-skill/agents/openai.yaml ~/.agents/skills/memory/agents/
```

> **Note:** Codex supports `AGENTS.override.md` for temporary instruction overrides without editing the base file.

### Shared Memory

Both Claude Code and Codex CLI point to the same `~/.claude-memory/` database. Knowledge saved by one is instantly available to the other:

```
                    ~/.claude-memory/
                    (SQLite + ChromaDB)
                          |
              +-----------+-----------+
              |                       |
        Claude Code               Codex CLI
   (~/.claude/settings.json)  (~/.codex/config.toml)
              |                       |
              +--- Same server.py ----+
              +--- Same 20 tools -----+
              +--- Same dashboard ----+
```

**Important:** Do not run both CLIs simultaneously. SQLite supports only one writer at a time. Close one CLI before starting the other. The dashboard (read-only) can run alongside either CLI safely.

### Hooks Limitations (Codex)

Codex CLI's hook system is experimental and more limited than Claude Code's. The key difference:

| Hook | Claude Code | Codex CLI |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| SessionStart | Stable -- reminds to call `memory_recall` | Not available -- instructions in AGENTS.md compensate |
| Stop | Stable -- reminds to save knowledge | Not available -- instructions in AGENTS.md compensate |
| PostToolUse | Stable -- suggests `memory_save` after git/docker | Experimental (`AfterToolUse` in v0.99.0+) |
| Notification | Stable -- macOS/Windows alerts | `notify` config -- agent-turn-complete only |

Because of this, the `AGENTS.md.template` and `codex-global-rules.md.template` include stronger, more prominent instructions for manual recall and save steps.

An optional `hooks/codex-notify.sh` is provided for the `notify` mechanism:

```toml
# ~/.codex/config.toml
notify = ["/path/to/claude-total-memory/hooks/codex-notify.sh"]
```

### Claude Code vs Codex CLI -- Comparison

| Aspect | Claude Code | Codex CLI |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Instructions file | `CLAUDE.md` | `AGENTS.md` |
| Global instructions | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` |
| MCP config | `~/.claude/settings.json` (JSON) | `~/.codex/config.toml` (TOML) |
| Hooks | 5 stable events | Experimental |
| Custom agents | `.claude/agents/*.md` | `.agents/skills/` |
| Installer | `install.sh` / `install.ps1` | `install-codex.sh` / `install-codex.ps1` |
| Override mechanism | None | `AGENTS.override.md` |
| MCP tools | All 20 | All 20 (identical) |
| Dashboard | Shared | Shared |
| Memory database | `~/.claude-memory/` | `~/.claude-memory/` (same) |

## Upgrading from v3.x

If you are upgrading from v3.x (19 tools) to v4.0 (20 tools):

**1. Update the code**

```bash
cd /path/to/claude-total-memory
git pull origin main
```

**2. Database migration**

No manual migration is needed. The server automatically:
- Adds `branch` column to `sessions` and `knowledge` tables
- Creates the new `observations` table
- Adds missing FTS5 DELETE trigger for errors
- Adds indexes on the `relations` table

Your existing data is untouched.

**3. Dashboard**

The new tabs (Live Feed, branch filter, token column) and the observations stat card appear automatically. Restart the dashboard:

```bash
# macOS
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.claude-total-memory.dashboard
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-total-memory.dashboard.plist
```

**4. Register new hooks (optional)**

The new `auto-capture` hooks suggest `memory_observe` after file changes. Either re-run `install.sh` (it registers all hooks automatically) or add manually:

```json
{
  "PostToolUse": [
    { "type": "command", "command": "/path/to/hooks/auto-capture.sh", "matcher": "Write" },
    { "type": "command", "command": "/path/to/hooks/auto-capture.sh", "matcher": "Edit" }
  ]
}
```

**5. Update CLAUDE.md templates (optional)**

Copy the updated `CLAUDE.md.template` to your projects to enable privacy tags and observation instructions.

### What's new in v4.0

- **Privacy stripping**: automatic redaction of API keys, JWTs, passwords, emails, credit cards before storage
- **`<private>` tags**: explicitly exclude sensitive content from knowledge
- **Branch-aware context**: knowledge tagged with git branch, filterable on recall
- **3-level progressive disclosure**: compact (~50 tokens/result), summary, full -- up to 10x token savings
- **Token cost estimation**: each result includes estimated tokens
- **`memory_observe` tool**: lightweight file change tracking (30-day retention)
- **SSE Live Feed**: real-time dashboard tab showing knowledge, errors, observations as they happen
- **Branch filter**: filter knowledge by git branch in the dashboard
- **Token column**: see token estimates in the knowledge table
- **BM25 fix**: batch-relative normalization for better ranking
- **Performance**: optimized search_by_tag, indexed relations table, fixed double dedup

---

## Upgrading from v2.x

If you are upgrading from v2.x (13 tools) to v3.0 (19 tools):

**1. Update the code**

```bash
cd /path/to/claude-total-memory
git pull origin main
```

Or re-clone if you prefer a fresh copy.

**2. Install dependencies**

No new dependencies are required. The self-improvement system uses only SQLite and the existing Python stdlib.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # just in case
```

**3. Database migration**

No manual migration is needed. The server automatically creates the three new tables (`errors`, `insights`, `rules`) and their FTS5 indexes on first startup. Your existing knowledge, sessions, and relations are untouched.

**4. Dashboard**

The two new tabs (Self-Improvement, Rules/SOUL) and the self-improvement stat card appear automatically. Restart the dashboard if it is running as a service:

```bash
# macOS
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.claude-total-memory.dashboard
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-total-memory.dashboard.plist
```

```powershell
# Windows
Restart-ScheduledTask -TaskName ClaudeTotalMemoryDashboard
```

**5. Configure self-improvement instructions (optional)**

For Claude to use the new self-improvement tools automatically, add the self-improvement block to your `CLAUDE.md`. The key instructions are:

- Call `self_rules_context(project="...")` at session start
- Call `self_error_log(...)` automatically on every error
- Call `self_insight(action='add', ...)` when pattern detected
- Call `self_reflect(...)` at session end
- Rate rules after task completion

See `global-rules.md.template` for the full ready-to-paste block.
